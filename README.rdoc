== MM Copyrights

Add copyrights to your source files.

== Copyrights (I know this is a bit recursive)

Copyright © 2012 Micah Martin.
MM Copyrights and all included source files are distributed under terms of the MIT License.

== Install

	gem sources -a http://gems.github.com
	sudo gem install slagyr-mmcopyrights
	
== Example
	
	require 'mmcopyrights'
	MM::Copyrights.process("lib", "rb", "#-", "©2009 Micah Martin\nAll rights reserved")
	
== Usage

	MM::Copyrights.process(SOURCE_DIRECTORY, FILE_EXTENSION, COMMENT_PREFIX, COPYRIGHT_TEXT)
	
* SOURCE_DIRECTORY - A directory where you keep source files
* FILE_EXTENSION - To identify which files to process.  A values of "rb" will process all files ending in ".rb".
* COMMENT_PREFIX - Be sure to use a unique comment prefix like "#-" for Ruby and "//-" for C, Java, C#, etc.  This is used to identify existing copyright headers to remove or update them.
* COPYRIGHT_TEXT - The content of your copyright message (without comment prefix)

== Description

Running MM::Copyrights.process will add the COPYRIGHT_TEXT to all of the matching files in the SOURCE_DIRECTORY.  Processing the files multiple times is harmless.  

You can change the COPYRIGHT_TEXT and process files again.  The old copyright headers will be replaced with the new content.
